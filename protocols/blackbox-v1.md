# FlatPPL black-box protocol, version 1

This document defines how a FlatPPL engine (the client) queries a box server over HTTP. A box server hosts one or more boxes. A box implements the members of a [black-box module](../docs/04-design.md#black-box-modules): functions, kernels or measures.

This protocol is not part of the FlatPPL language specification and is versioned separately. Its queries use the [black-box query profile](../docs/12-profiles.md#sec:blackbox).

## Overview

- The client sends each query as a multipart HTTP POST.
- The query is FlatPPL text in the black-box query profile.
- Data parts and reply parts are Arrow IPC streams.
- Large values are content-addressed. The client uploads a value once and then refers to it by its SHA-256 hash.
- Every query is pure. A sampling query carries an explicit RNG state. The server may answer an identical query from its cache.

All paths are under the prefix `/v1`. A server that changes this protocol incompatibly uses a new prefix.

## Endpoints

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/boxes` | List the boxes, one name per line (`text/plain`). |
| `GET /v1/boxes/{box}/describe` | Describe the members of a box (JSON). |
| `POST /v1/query` | Evaluate a query (multipart). |
| `HEAD /v1/objects/sha256/{hex}` | Check whether the store holds an object: 200 or 404. |
| `PUT /v1/objects/sha256/{hex}` | Upload an object: 201, or 200 if the store holds it already. |

`{hex}` is the lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 of the object bytes, 64 characters. Box names match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.

## Values in Arrow

A FlatPPL value maps to one element of an Arrow array:

| FlatPPL value | Arrow type |
|---|---|
| real | `Float64` or `Float32` |
| integer | `Int64` (a request may also use any other integer type) |
| boolean | `Boolean` |
| array of shape `[d1, ..., dk]` | `k` nested `FixedSizeList`s, outermost of size `d1`, row-major |
| array of arrays | the outer array's `FixedSizeList`s around the element arrays |
| record | `Struct`, one child per field, in field order |

An array of `n` vectors of length `d` and an `n` by `d` matrix have the same Arrow type. They are different values ([§03](../docs/03-value-types.md): vectors of vectors are not matrices), and the value set tells them apart: `cartpow(cartpow(reals, d), n)` and `cartpow(reals, [n, d])`.

A data part may use `List` or `LargeList` wherever this table has `FixedSizeList`, if every list has the size that the value set gives.

The protocol does not require 64-bit floats. A box answers in the precision it computes. A client converts if it needs another precision.

### Part layout

A data part holds one value as an Arrow IPC stream, in this layout:

- A scalar: one column, one row.
- A record: one row, one column per field.
- An array of shape `[n, d2, ..., dk]` of scalars: one column with `n` rows. Each row holds the sub-array of shape `[d2, ..., dk]`, or a scalar if `k = 1`.
- An array of `n` arrays: one column with `n` rows. Each row holds one element array.
- A table of `n` rows: one column per table column, `n` rows.

A single-column part may give its column any name. A part may split its rows over several record batches. A reply part carries the schema metadata key `flatppl.valueset`, whose value is the value set of the part as FlatPPL text, for example `cartpow(reals, [100, 3])`.

An Arrow IPC file (magic `ARROW1`) is accepted wherever a stream is.

## Query

### Request

`POST /v1/query` takes `multipart/form-data`. Each part has a `Content-Disposition` name.

| Part name | Content type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | `text/x-flatppl; charset=utf-8` | The query text. Required. |
| `options` | `application/json` | Request options. Optional. |
| any other name | `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream` | A data part. |

A data part name matches `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`. A request may carry at most one part of each name.

### Query text

The query text is a FlatPPL module in the black-box query profile ([`blackbox.flatprof`](../profiles/blackbox.flatprof)). It has these bindings and no others:

- **Box.** Exactly one binding `B = load_module("box:<name>")`, where `<name>` is a box on this server. The alias `B` is free.
- **Data.** Any number of bindings `D = load_data(S, V)`. `S` is `"part:<name>"`, a data part of this request, or `"sha256:<hex>"`, an object in the store. `V` is the value set of the data, and must not be `anything` ([§07](../docs/07-functions.md#load_data) refuses access to such data). The server checks the data against `V`. A request part is also stored under its hash, so a later request may refer to it by hash.
- **Literals.** Any number of bindings to scalar literals, array literals of scalars, and record literals of these.
- **RNG.** Bindings `R = rnginit(seed)` and `R = rngstate(bytes)`, where `seed` is an integer or byte-vector literal and `bytes` is a byte-vector literal or a data binding. An array of RNG states for a batched sample is `R = broadcast(rnginit, seeds)` or `R = broadcast(rngstate, states)`, also written `rnginit.(seeds)` and `rngstate.(states)`. `seeds` is a vector of integers or of byte vectors, and `states` a vector of byte vectors, each a literal or a data binding.
- **Result.** Exactly one binding named `result`, with one of the forms below.

The sources `box:`, `part:` and `sha256:` are defined by this protocol and are valid only in its queries ([§04](../docs/04-design.md#sec:url-cache)).

An argument is a binding name, a literal, or a record literal of these. `M` is a member of the box, written `B.M`.

| Result form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `B.f(args...)` | Apply function member `f`. |
| `builtin_logdensityof(B.K, input, x)` | Log density of kernel member `K` at `x`. |
| `builtin_logdensityof(B.M, x)` | Log density of measure member `M` at `x`. |
| `builtin_sample(rng, B.K, input, n, ...)` | Draw from kernel member `K`. The sizes are optional. |
| `builtin_sample(rng, B.M, n, ...)` | Draw from measure member `M`. The sizes are optional. |
| `builtin_touniform(B.K, input, x)`, and the other three transports | Transport ([§07](../docs/07-functions.md)), if the member supports it. |
| `broadcast(callee, args...)` | Batch one of the forms above. |
| `broadcast(builtin_sample, rngs, B.K, input, n, ...)` | Draw from kernel member `K` once per row, row `i` with RNG state `i` of the array `rngs`. |

A measure member is a nullary kernel and takes no `input` argument ([§07](../docs/07-functions.md#sec:measure-eval-prims)). The server resolves the arity from the member kind.

`broadcast` follows [§04](../docs/04-design.md#sec:broadcasting). `callee` is a function member, or one of `builtin_logdensityof` and the four transports. Array arguments are iterated elementwise, tables row-wise, and members and scalars are held constant. Size-one axes expand. An element of an array is its entry, so a matrix broadcasts to scalars, and an array of vectors broadcasts one vector per row. For example, `broadcast(builtin_logdensityof, B.M, thetas)` with `thetas` in `cartpow(cartpow(reals, 2), 100)` gives 100 log densities, and with `thetas` in `cartpow(reals, [100, 2])` it gives 200.

`broadcast(builtin_sample, rngs, ...)` takes an array of RNG states, one per row. `rngs` has one axis and its length is the number of rows. It never expands, so the other collections have one axis as well. The sizes are scalars, held constant. A single RNG state, or an array of one state for several rows, is refused with 422. Row `i` equals the unbatched query with state `i`, so a batched sample does not depend on how the box splits a state.

A table is accepted only as a `broadcast` operand in version 1.

The server checks data parts against their value sets. It also checks the arguments of the result against the value sets that the member declares (see Describe): the input of every query, and the point of `builtin_logdensityof`, `builtin_touniform` and `builtin_tonormal` against the variate. Under `broadcast` it checks each row. The check covers shape, integer versus real, and interval bounds, and refuses a mismatch with 400. An integer is a real ([§03](../docs/03-value-types.md)), but a real is never an integer. The box may check more.

Version 1 refuses all other forms with 422. Examples are measure algebra on a member, a query on two boxes, and computation on data.

Example:

```flatppl
bb = load_module("box:normal")
theta = load_data("part:theta", cartpow(reals, 2))
x = load_data("sha256:6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d", cartpow(reals, 1000))
result = builtin_logdensityof(bb.K, theta, x)
```

### Options

`options` is a JSON object. Unknown keys are refused with 400.

```json
{"derivative": {"kind": "gradient", "wrt": ["theta"]}}
{"derivative": {"kind": "vjp", "wrt": ["theta"], "cotangent": "ct"}}
```

- `wrt` lists data or literal binding names of the query. The server returns one derivative per name. The derivative of a table binding is a table with one column per table column.
- `gradient` returns the gradient of the sum of all result entries. For a scalar result this is the ordinary gradient. For a broadcast it is the per-row gradient for a batched argument, and the sum over rows for a held-constant argument.
- `vjp` returns the vector-Jacobian product with the cotangent. `cotangent` names a data binding of the query whose value has the shape of the result. For a result that is an array of arrays, the multi-axis array of the same entries is accepted too.
- A derivative of `builtin_sample`, a derivative the member does not support, or a derivative with respect to an integer or boolean binding is refused with 422.

### RNG state

- The box defines its RNG algorithm and the byte encoding of its state. The encoding must identify the algorithm, so that the box refuses a foreign state with 422.
- `rnginit(seed)` starts a fresh state. An integer seed `n` means the 8-byte little-endian encoding of `n` ([§07](../docs/07-functions.md)).
- `rngstate(bytes)` resumes a state that a previous reply returned.
- A batched sample returns one new state per row. The client resumes row `i` with state `i`, for example through `rngstate.(states)` with the `rngstate` part as a data part.
- A sampling reply carries the new state. The client passes it to the next sampling query. Equal states and equal queries give equal samples.

### Reply

A successful query returns 200 with `multipart/mixed`. Each part is an Arrow IPC stream in the part layout, named by its `Content-Disposition` name:

| Part name | When | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | always | The result. For `builtin_sample`, the samples `X`. |
| `d_<name>` | for each `wrt` name | The derivative, with the shape of binding `<name>`. |
| `rngstate` | for `builtin_sample` | The new RNG state: a vector of integers in `0..255`. For a batched sample, an array with one such vector per row. |

The result of a `broadcast` is the array of the per-row results ([§04](../docs/04-design.md#sec:broadcasting)). A result that is an array stays one element, so the reply is an array of arrays, encoded as nested `FixedSizeList`s. For example, a function from reals to `cartpow(reals, 2)` broadcast over 3 rows gives 3 vectors, in `cartpow(cartpow(reals, 2), 3)`. The samples `X` of `builtin_sample` with sizes `n, ...` are an array of that shape whose elements are variates ([§06 `iid`](../docs/06-measure-algebra.md#iid)). A batched sample is the array of the per-row `X`. A kernel with variate `cartpow(reals, 2)` gives `cartpow(cartpow(reals, 2), 3)` over 3 rows, and `cartpow(cartpow(cartpow(reals, 2), 4), 3)` with size 4.

An array of arrays and a multi-axis array have the same Arrow type, so the `flatppl.valueset` metadata tells them apart. It uses the member's declared `output` or `variate` set, and the server refuses a box result outside that set with 500. For a member that declares `anything`, nested lists in a result read as a multi-axis array.

Parts come in this order. The `value` part may stream in several record batches, so a client can read a large result before the reply ends.

A degenerate mathematical result is a value, not an error. For example, a log density outside the support is `-inf`, and an undefined result is `NaN`.

### Errors

An error reply has a status code and an `application/problem+json` body (RFC 9457) with at least `title` and `detail`.

| Status | Meaning | Client action |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Malformed request: a parse error, a missing `result`, a missing part, a bad option, data that does not match its value set. | Fix the request. |
| 404 | A `sha256:` reference is not in the store. The body lists every missing hash in `missing`. | Upload each object, then retry. |
| 422 | An unsupported query: unknown box or member, a form outside the profile, a query the member does not declare, an unsupported derivative, a foreign RNG state. | Do not retry. |
| 500 | The box failed. | Report the box failure. |

An unknown path also returns 404, without a `missing` field.

## Describe

`GET /v1/boxes/{box}/describe` returns `application/json`. The JSON object maps each member name to a member object:

```json
{
  "posterior": {"kind": "measure", "queries": ["builtin_logdensityof"], "gradient": true, "vjp": false, "variate": "cartpow(reals, 2)", "normalized": false},
  "f": {"kind": "function", "queries": ["apply"], "gradient": true, "vjp": true, "input": "cartpow(reals, 3)", "output": "reals"},
  "K": {"kind": "kernel", "queries": ["builtin_logdensityof", "builtin_sample"], "gradient": false, "vjp": false, "input": "cartprod(mu = reals, sigma = posreals)", "variate": "reals", "normalized": true}
}
```

| Key | Members | JSON type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | all | string | `"function"`, `"kernel"` or `"measure"`. |
| `queries` | all | array of strings | The supported query forms: `"apply"`, `"builtin_logdensityof"`, `"builtin_sample"`, and the transport names. |
| `gradient`, `vjp` | all | boolean | Whether the deterministic queries support this derivative. |
| `input` | functions, kernels | string | The value set of the input. |
| `output` | functions | string | The value set of the output. |
| `variate` | kernels, measures | string | The value set of the variate. |
| `normalized` | kernels, measures | boolean | `true` if every measure has total mass 1. |

A value set is a FlatPPL set expression ([§03](../docs/03-value-types.md)) in a JSON string, for example `"cartpow(reals, 10)"`. The server parses and checks each one with the FlatPPL parser. A value set may be `"anything"`. `builtin_sample` is listed only for a normalized member, because only a probability measure can be sampled.

A function or kernel takes one input. An input with a record set takes keyword arguments, as in `B.f(a = x, b = y)` ([§04 calling convention](../docs/04-design.md#sec:calling-convention)).

## Store

The store holds objects by content hash. Objects never expire on content grounds, because a hash cannot go stale. A server may still evict objects, and then answers 404 for them.

`PUT /v1/objects/sha256/{hex}` takes the raw bytes (`application/octet-stream` or `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`). The server computes the SHA-256 of the body and refuses a mismatch with 400. A query may refer only to objects in the store and parts of the same request.

## Caching and memoization

A query is a pure function of its text, its data and its options. The server may cache replies. The cache key is the SHA-256 of the box name, the canonical query text with each `part:` source replaced by its `sha256:` source, and the canonical options. A cache hit returns the same bytes as the original reply.

## Security

- Serve over HTTPS outside a trusted network.
- Use standard HTTP authentication (the `Authorization` header). The server decides the scheme.
- The server verifies every upload against its hash.
- A query reads only uploaded objects and parts of its own request. A query never names a file path or a URL.
